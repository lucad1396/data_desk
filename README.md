# 📊 Data Desk

A collection of simple, practical guides on working with data in Python - from data wrangling with **Pandas** to creating insightful visuals with **Seaborn** and other libraries.

This repository is meant as a personal reference and learning tool, but also as a resource for others who want clear, example-driven introductions to essential tools in the data science workflow.

## 📁 Contents

- `pandas_guide.ipynb` - Step-by-step guide to data manipulation with **Pandas**, covering:

  - DataFrames, Series, and indexing
  - Reading, inspecting & cleaning data
  - Grouping, sorting, and aggregation
  - Handling missing values and duplicates
  - Transformations with `map`, `apply`, `replace`
  - Feature engineering & preprocessing
  - Merging, joining & concatenating datasets
  - Bonus: Tips for large datasets

- `seaborn_guide.ipynb` - A guide to data visualization using Seaborn, including:
  - Core plots: scatter, bar, histogram, box, violin
  - Categorical vs continuous plotting
  - Customizing styles and palettes
  - Plotting distributions and correlations
  - Combining plots (e.g. `pairplot`, `catplot`, `FacetGrid`)

- `datasets/` - Contains small datasets used in the notebooks (e.g. CSVs from seaborn, open datasets).

## 🚀 Why This Exists

This repository helps reinforce best practices in handling and visualizing data. It’s designed to be:
- **Practical**: Minimal theory, lots of examples.
- **Readable**: Clean notebooks, commented code.
- **Re-usable**: A toolkit for real projects and interviews.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## 📌 Next Steps

This repo is part of a broader effort to transition into industry roles in data science and machine learning. Upcoming companion repos:
- `ml_desk/`: Guides on regression, classification, model evaluation, and ML workflows.
- `projects/`: End-to-end case studies applying these tools to real-world datasets.
